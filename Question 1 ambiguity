GPS carrier-phase measurements can be used to achieve very precise positioning solutions.
Carrier-phase measurements are much more precise than pseudorange measurements, but they are 
ambiguous by an integer number of cycles. 

5.1 (from paper mathematically expression )
Recall from Equation 2 that the Phase Lock Loop (PLL) only measures the fractional part of 
the range, leaving an un- known of λN. Once the drone is flying, additional multiples of wavelengths
can also accumulate, called cycle slips. We first describe ways to mitigate the initial λN and discuss 
cycle slips thereafter.
Note that we do not need to estimate N since we are not
computing the actual range (or location) of the GPS receiver.
Since we only care about orientation, we have been oper-
ating in the space of differentials. Thus, when we compute
Ns =Ns −Ns,followedbyNsk =Ns −Nk,werecognize ij i j ij ij ij
that Nsk are also integers. Our goal is to estimate these Nsk ij ij
integers, for all combinations of ij and sk.
